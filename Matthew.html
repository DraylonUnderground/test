Five Recommendations

1)	The YouTube video needs embedding in the instructions to avoid the user having to navigate away from the site.
2)	For some of the instructions I would send the details to another page e.g. ‘For more information about Master Seed, click here’
3)	There are a few clunky grammatical issues.
4)	The language used needs a little more standardisation. For example, some of the pages are referred to as ‘pages’, and sometimes as ‘screens’
5)	Overall I would break up the Getting Started page into smaller pages.
